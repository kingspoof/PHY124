## Wrap up
List the Python operators to add, subtract, multiply and the 3 different divisions.
```
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ normal division
// division where the floor is returned to get an int
% Modulo, division with rest
```

### List the comparison operators and their meaning.
```
== (Equal)
!= (Not Equal)
> (Greater Than)
< (Less than)
>= (Greater than or equal)
<= (Less than or equal)
% Modulo and so on
```

### How do you do exponents in Python?
```
You do (base)**(exponentn)
```

### How do you define imaginary numbers in Python?
```
imaginary = 8 + 5j, where 8 is the real part and 5 the imaginary part,
python does not use i as the imaginary number but j
```

### Why does Python sometimes write numbers like 1.8665272370064378e-301 and what does this mean?
```
Basically 0
Python uses floating point arithmetic to display a wide range of number from very small to very large, this does result in errors as we can see when multpilying 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.300000000000004
```

### How do you output some information to the user?
```
print(''), use print('value', end="") if no linebreak is desired
```

### How do you reuse existing code (written by you or others)?
```
	You copy it into our code or import their package
```

### What is the structure of a complex conditional statement (including if, else and elif)?
```
if(condition 1):
    do something
elseif(condition 2):
    do something else
else:
    will be done when neither condition 1 or 2 are true
```

### What is the structure of a while-loop?
```
while(condition): 
	do things
```

### When does a while-loop terminate?
when the condition is no longer true
